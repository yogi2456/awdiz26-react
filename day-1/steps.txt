redux concept
npm i redux react-redux
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
first create a componet like counterRedux
and create a folder redux and in this one file store.js and two folders in this two folders
1. action > counter.action.js       
 in this action we should only create a functions                    
2. reducer > 1. counter.reducer.js 2. rootreducer.js
in this counter reducer we should create a initial state and reducer (state, action) > switch(action.type) and cases
in this rootreducer import the counter reducer and create a instance and import the combinereducer and call the function and pass the object

in the redux file store.js in this import the rootreducer and create a instance and import the configurestore and call the function and pass the object eith using reducer

in the component of counterredux in this import the action function and import usedispatch, useselector and we call the function with dispatch
const dispatch = usedispatch();
and with useselector call a atate
const counter = useselector((state) => state.(rootreducer)counter.(counterreducer)counter)
and  <h1>{counter}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(Increment())}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(Decrement())}>-</button>
